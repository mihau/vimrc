This repository is used to track my vimrc, so that I can easily enjoy the same
configuration on each host I work on. Plugins are managed using Vundle, they
reside in bundle directory, each plugin is a git submodule.

Currently using:
- vundle
- airline
- fugitive
- nerdtree
- python-mode
- puppet
- tabular

### Installation
Download to ~/.vimrc and run install.sh, it should create ~/.vimrc symlink
and update each submodule.
